After many years meaning to start and stick to a blog, I am using the New Year to finally start.

The current technologies I am aiming to learn include [node.js][nodejs], [mongoDB][mongodb], [Sass][sass], [gulp.js][gulp], and [Polymer][polymer], and so the following posts will most likely be about my experience with those in various projects. Alternatively they could be about my time spent as a student at [Loughborough University][lboro].

In short, I aim to document what I learn, experience and think, so there's really no telling what's going to end up here.

[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org/
[mongodb]: http://www.mongodb.org/
[sass]: http://sass-lang.com/
[gulp]: http://gulpjs.com/
[polymer]: https://www.polymer-project.org/
[lboro]: http://www.lboro.ac.uk/
